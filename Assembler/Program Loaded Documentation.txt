Program Loader Documentation:
	Use:
		programLoader program.bin <memory.coe> <kernel.bin>

		Data can be preloaded into the memory file by adding:

					loc = data

		to the end of the assembly

		loc being the exact location (in decimal) above the program
		and below 15480 (15480 to 20480 is user stack, can use but be careful)
		and above 10000 or the end of your program, your decision

		data is a 4 digit hex number, must be at most 4 digits, in hex.

		please augment with zeroes, not doing so is untested because 
		coe files are weird.

		example : 10101 = abcd

		there is not a lot of checking in this code, if it fails, that is on you ;)

		kernel code     [0:4096)
		user code       [4096:10000) <can be more, your call>
		user space      [10000:15480)
		stack           [15480:20480] <will underflow if you let it, grows down>

		Example Use:
			programLoader.py relPrimeWithIO.bin
