Milestone One
-------------

In this milestone we accomplished the following:

*	Decided on CPU Architecture (hybrid of load-store and x86)
*	Decided on CPU Instruction set basics
*	Wrote Assembly instructions for RelPrime

Alex and Wesley worked on the design of the CPU and Instruction set. Wesley created 
the documentation and Charlie scribed and provided arguments and counter arguments for 
ideas.  Andrew didn't show up or reply to emails.
